### System Administrator, TPS Srl; Rome, IT — 2000-2003

A medium-sized company with two offices in Rome, TPS gave me the opportunity to
advance my knowledge of networks as well as advanced web development.

### Teacher, IAL; Frosinone, IT — 1999-2000

IAL is a Regional Training Institute where I held courses on Multimedia Content
Editing, Networking and the Internet.

### System Administrator, Flashnet Srl; Frosinone, IT — 1996-2000

One of the first Internet Service Providers operating in Italy, Flashnet had a
dial-up access node with hundreds of users in Frosinone. I operated the Unix
servers and checked the operation of network services. I also participated in a
development group of three tier web applications.

## Skills

Since the very beginning of my professional career I mainly worked with open
source software, which has given me a better understanding of its community,
processes and strengths. I am passionate about technology, innovation and
usability, and I’m always on the lookout for new ways to advance my productivity
and the quality of my work.
