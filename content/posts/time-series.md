# Time Series Data and CompletableFuture example in Java

Full code for all the examples can be found
[here](https://github.com/mcaserta/time-series-concurrency-example).

## How to run the program

```shell
mvn clean compile verify exec:java
```

## Preface

Suppose we want to calculate an _air quality index_ based on two values:

- air temperature
- percentage of carbon monoxide in the air

Given the following symbols:

| symbol | meaning                                  |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `AQi`  | air quality index                        |
| `T`    | air temperature in Celsius degrees       |
| `Tm`   | maximum air temperature in C°            |
| `C`    | percentage of carbon monoxide in the air |

We may calculate the `AQi` with the following sorry excuse of a formula:

<!-- AQi = (((T * 100) / Tm) + C) / 2 -->

![air quality formula](../images/posts/air-quality-formula.png)

**DISCLAIMER:** please note that this formula is in no way scientific, and it's
intended for educational purposes only. I don't want environmentalists and real
scientists chasing me around with math formulas and accusations of quackery.
Also, I saw a chance for a pretty LaTeX equation and I took it, because
aesthetics... and it makes me look smart, which I certainly am not[^school].

What the formula attempts to say is that as the temperature and the carbon
monoxide percentage rise, the air quality decreases. Yeah, this is totally
unscientific but bear with me for the sake of argumentation, please.

I assume a maximum temperature of 40C°. So, for instance:

```shell
$ bc -l
bc 1.06

t=60; c=100; tm=40; (((t * 100) / tm) + c) / 2
125.00000000000000000000
t=60; c=50; tm=40; (((t * 100) / tm) + c) / 2
100.00000000000000000000
t=40; c=50; tm=40; (((t * 100) / tm) + c) / 2
75.00000000000000000000
t=40; c=10; tm=40; (((t * 100) / tm) + c) / 2
55.00000000000000000000
t=20; c=10; tm=40; (((t * 100) / tm) + c) / 2
30.00000000000000000000
t=10; c=5; tm=40; (((t * 100) / tm) + c) / 2
15.00000000000000000000
t=10; c=0.5; tm=40; (((t * 100) / tm) + c) / 2
12.75000000000000000000
```

From this we can derive the following totally unscientific table:

| AQi         | meaning                             |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 125 to ∞    | horrible death                      |
| 100 to 125  | painful death                       |
| 75 to 100   | death                               |
| 55 to 75    | it is acceptable[^it-is-acceptable] |
| 30 to 55    | this is fine[^this-is-fine]         |
| 15 to 30    | fine and dandy                      |
| 12.75 to 15 | pretty cool                         |
| -∞ to 12.75 | welcome to Yakutsk, probably        |

## Service providers

Suppose we have internet services that expose temperature and carbon monoxide
level monitoring values. These services might expose an api that gives us time
series data[^time-series-data].

So, for instance, we might call a temperature monitoring service, and it would
respond with time series data like this:

| timestamp              | value  |
| ---------------------- | ------ |
| `2021-01-20T08:00:00Z` | `10.1` |
| `2021-01-20T08:02:00Z` | `10.3` |
| `2021-01-20T08:05:00Z` | `10.7` |
| `2021-01-20T08:06:00Z` | `10.9` |
| `2021-01-20T08:06:19Z` | `11.0` |
| `2021-01-20T08:06:42Z` | `11.1` |
| `2021-01-20T08:09:00Z` | `11.3` |

A carbon monoxide percentage monitoring service might instead respond with data
that looks like this:

| timestamp              | value |
| ---------------------- | ----- |
| `2021-01-20T08:01:00Z` | `2.0` |
| `2021-01-20T08:02:00Z` | `2.3` |
| `2021-01-20T08:06:00Z` | `2.8` |
| `2021-01-20T08:07:00Z` | `2.9` |
| `2021-01-20T08:08:00Z` | `3.3` |

Please note that I have sorted the data by timestamp to make it a bit more
readable, but you shouldn't make assumptions on the sort order of the data
returned by an external provider. Not that this is of any importance here as...

# The algorithm

...our algorithm now requires:

1. concatenating the temperature and carbon monoxide percentage data
2. sorting by timestamp

| id   | timestamp              | value  | type |
| ---- | ---------------------- | ------ | ---- |
| `1`  | `2021-01-20T08:00:00Z` | `10.1` | `T`  |
| `2`  | `2021-01-20T08:01:00Z` | ` 2.0` | `C`  |
| `3`  | `2021-01-20T08:02:00Z` | `10.3` | `T`  |
| `4`  | `2021-01-20T08:02:00Z` | ` 2.3` | `C`  |
| `5`  | `2021-01-20T08:05:00Z` | `10.7` | `T`  |
| `6`  | `2021-01-20T08:06:00Z` | `10.9` | `T`  |
| `7`  | `2021-01-20T08:06:00Z` | ` 2.8` | `C`  |
| `8`  | `2021-01-20T08:06:19Z` | `11.0` | `T`  |
| `9`  | `2021-01-20T08:06:42Z` | `11.1` | `T`  |
| `10` | `2021-01-20T08:07:00Z` | ` 2.9` | `C`  |
| `11` | `2021-01-20T08:08:00Z` | ` 3.3` | `C`  |
| `12` | `2021-01-20T08:09:00Z` | `11.3` | `T`  |

> type: T is temperature and C is carbon monoxide percentage

Our task now is to scan the data, starting from the beginning, one row at a
time, computing the air quality index as we go forward, step by step.

The first thing to note here is that to compute our `AQi` formula we need to
have both values for `T` and `C`. In other words, the first time point where we
can apply our formula is that with id `2` as we have a value for `T` in id `1`
and a value for `C` in id `2`. So we take our values (`10.1` for `T` and `2.0`
for `C`), apply the formula, and we have a first `AQi` value of `13.625` which
we associate with the timestamp in id `2`, as that is the moment our computation
refers to. Our first `AQi` entry in the resulting time series should now look
like this:

| timestamp              | value    |
| ---------------------- | -------- |
| `2021-01-20T08:01:00Z` | `13.625` |

From now on, our calculation can be applied to every remaining element in the
time series, keeping in mind that we must correlate each value with the most
recent value of the other type. In other words:

| for id | pick values from id |
| ------ | ------------------- |
| `2`    | `1, 2`              |
| `3`    | `2, 3`              |
| `4`    | `3, 4`              |
| `5`    | `4, 5`              |
| `6`    | `4, 6`              |
| `7`    | `6, 7`              |
| `8`    | `7, 8`              |
| `9`    | `7, 9`              |
| `10`   | `9, 10`             |
| `11`   | `9, 11`             |
| `12`   | `11, 12`            |

You can think of this kind of motion as a
[rolling time window](https://towardsdatascience.com/time-series-analysis-resampling-shifting-and-rolling-f5664ddef77e)
as you have a window that moves forward in time focusing on the most recent data
for our specific `T` and `C` measures at each step[^creep].

| `2021-01-20T08:08:00Z` | `15.525` |
| `2021-01-20T08:09:00Z` | `15.775` |

If you've looked closely, you might have noticed that we have a couple duplicate
timestamps in our results, specifically `2021-01-20T08:02:00Z` and
`2021-01-20T08:06:00Z`. These represent a time paradox as it appears that our
`AQi` has two different values at the same time.

![I find your lack of logic disturbing](../images/posts/i-find-your-lack-of-logic-disturbing.jpg)

We both know this data is eventually going to show up on a web page. Also, we
wouldn't want one of those hipster javascript frontend developers to point out a
lack of logic or, worse, an inconsistency in our data to us, wouldn't we?

Yeah, I thought so. So, my idea is that we can safely discard the first entry of
a duplicate timestamp as it refers to a calculation with stale data. Why? Well,
consider the values for the first duplicate timestamp: `2021-01-20T08:02:00Z`.
The first time we computed the `AQi`, we picked data from id `2` and `3` and id
`2` refers to a previous timestamp, specifically `2021-01-20T08:01:00Z`. The
second time we computed the `AQi`, we were using data from id `3` and `4`, which
both refer to timestamp `2021-01-20T08:02:00Z`, so this computation's result is
more relevant than the previous one which we stamped with the same
`2021-01-20T08:02:00Z` timestamp.

The same thing applies to the `AQi` entry with timestamp `2021-01-20T08:06:00Z`
as the first computation was using ids `4` and `6` while the second was
considering ids `6` and `7` which are fresher than the timestamp in id `4`.

So we erase a couple entries, and our clean result set now looks like this:

| timestamp              | value    |
| ---------------------- | -------- |
| `2021-01-20T08:01:00Z` | `13.625` |
| `2021-01-20T08:02:00Z` | `14.025` |
| `2021-01-20T08:05:00Z` | `14.525` |
| `2021-01-20T08:06:00Z` | `15.025` |
| `2021-01-20T08:06:19Z` | `15.150` |
| `2021-01-20T08:06:42Z` | `15.275` |
| `2021-01-20T08:07:00Z` | `15.325` |
| `2021-01-20T08:08:00Z` | `15.525` |
| `2021-01-20T08:09:00Z` | `15.775` |

Just as an equation is an excuse to brush up on some
[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/), a good time series is an excellent
candidate for [gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/).

![plot of the data so far](../images/posts/plot-output.png)

Real data is of course much more chaotic than this, and you might want to
normalize the result by an arbitrary time interval, say one minute:

| timestamp              | value    |
| ---------------------- | -------- |
| `2021-01-20T08:01:00Z` | `13.625` |
| `2021-01-20T08:02:00Z` | `14.025` |
| `2021-01-20T08:03:00Z` | `14.025` |
| `2021-01-20T08:04:00Z` | `14.025` |
| `2021-01-20T08:05:00Z` | `14.525` |
| `2021-01-20T08:06:00Z` | `15.025` |
| `2021-01-20T08:07:00Z` | `15.325` |
| `2021-01-20T08:08:00Z` | `15.525` |
| `2021-01-20T08:09:00Z` | `15.775` |

Makes sense? I certainly hope so.

![yes](../images/posts/yes.gif)

## Let's get coding

Time to write some code. First of all, let's define an interface for our `AQi`
calculator, so we can provide different implementations later on.

The code for this interface can be seen
[here](https://github.com/mcaserta/time-series-concurrency-example/blob/master/src/main/java/com/mirkocaserta/example/AirQualityIndexCalculator.java).

This interface makes for a convenient place to implement the `AQi` formula:

```java
static double airQualityIndex(double temperature, double carbonMonoxidePercentage, double maxTemperature) {
    return (((temperature * 100) / maxTemperature) + carbonMonoxidePercentage) / 2;
}
```

This method takes a temperature, a carbon monoxide percentage, a max temperature
and returns the `AQi`. Nice.

The interesting bit however is this method:

```java
List<TimeValue> calculate(List<TimeValue> temperatures, List<TimeValue> carbonMonoxidePercentages);
```

This says that the `calculate` method takes two lists of `TimeValue`s: the first
is a list of temperatures and the other is a list of carbon monoxide
percentages. It then returns a list of `TimeValue`s, only this time the list is
representing air quality indices.

What is a `TimeValue`? You can see its definition
[here](https://github.com/mcaserta/time-series-concurrency-example/blob/c5b4574a40be0a818aba1513aaef7cc9d2a41d2b/src/main/java/com/mirkocaserta/example/TimeValue.java#L7).
Although this seems horribly complicated due to the verbosity of the Java
language and a few implementation details, you can think of a time value as just
a convenient way to represent an `Instant` in time and its associated `value`.
Nothing fancy, really.

## Coding like it's 1984

Now that we have a basic framework for our calculations, let's write a first
implementation using the old school style. The complete code for this is
[here](https://github.com/mcaserta/time-series-concurrency-example/blob/master/src/main/java/com/mirkocaserta/example/OldSchoolAirQualityIndexCalculator.java).
Let's take a look.

Our calculator takes the max temperature in its constructor and stores its value
in the `maxTemperature` instance constant as we'll need its value later when
invoking the `AQi` function.

Our `calculate` method should start with these two steps:

1. concatenate the temperature and carbon monoxide percentage data in a single
   data structure
2. sort the resulting data by timestamp

Step 1 is implemented by this code:

```java
// key = time value type (C = carbonMonoxidePercentage, T = temperature)
// concatenated with the timestamp as a string
Map<String, TimeValue> timeValuesByType = new HashMap<>();

for (TimeValue temperature : temperatures) {
    timeValuesByType.put("T".concat(temperature.ts()), temperature);
}

for (TimeValue carbonMonoxidePercentage : carbonMonoxidePercentages) {
    timeValuesByType.put("C".concat(carbonMonoxidePercentage.ts()), carbonMonoxidePercentage);
}
```

The key in our `timeValuesByType` variable is a string concatenation of the
letter `T` for temperature or `C` for carbon monoxide percentage, followed by
the timestamp. We need to do this in order to later distinguish between the two
types of values. The key string will look like this:
`T2021-02-03T08:00:00.000Z`.

The sorting is done by this bit:

```java
Map<String, TimeValue> timeValuesByTypeSortedByTimestamp = new LinkedHashMap<>();
List<String> keysSortedByTimestamp = new ArrayList<>(timeValuesByType.keySet());
keysSortedByTimestamp.sort(comparing(s -> timeValuesByType.get(s).timestamp()));

for (String key : keysSortedByTimestamp) {
    timeValuesByTypeSortedByTimestamp.put(key, timeValuesByType.get(key));
}
```

This is just overcomplicated Java lingo for having our map sorted by the
timestamp we have in the Java map values. We declare a
`timeValuesByTypeSortedByTimestamp` map, implemented by a `LinkedHashMap`
because we want to preserve the iteration order of the map entries. Then we wrap
all the keys in our original `timeValuesByType` map in an ArrayList as we need a
`List` in order to then invoke `sort` on it. The comparator function we are
passing to sort is picking the timestamp of the relative entry in the original
`timeValuesByType` map. We then iterate `keysSortedByTimestamp`, adding entries
to our `timeValuesByTypeSortedByTimestamp` map.

Now we are declaring a map for the results of our `AQi` calculations and a
couple variables we'll need later:

```java
Map<Instant, Double> airQualityIndexMap = new HashMap<>();
TimeValue lastTemperature = null;
TimeValue lastCarbonMonoxidePercentage = null;
```

Here begins the fun part. We cycle through the map entries in our previously
defined `timeValuesByTypeSortedByTimestamp` variable.

```java
for (Map.Entry<String, TimeValue> entry : timeValuesByTypeSortedByTimestamp.entrySet()) {
    ...
```

We know that if the key begins with a `T`, we have a temperature value and, in
such case we store it in the `lastTemperature` variable. Otherwise, the value
must be of type `C` for carbon, so we do the same for the
`lastCarbonMonoxidePercentage` variable.

```java
if (entry.getKey().startsWith("T")) {
    lastTemperature = entry.getValue();
} else if (entry.getKey().startsWith("C")) {
    lastCarbonMonoxidePercentage = entry.getValue();
}
```

At this point, if we have a value both for `T` and `C`, we can proceed to
calculate our `AQi` and store its value in the `airQualityIndexMap` variable.

```java
if (lastTemperature != null && lastCarbonMonoxidePercentage != null) {
    airQualityIndexMap.put(
        mostRecent(lastTemperature.timestamp(), lastCarbonMonoxidePercentage.timestamp()),
        airQualityIndex(lastTemperature.value(), lastCarbonMonoxidePercentage.value(), maxTemperature)
    );
}
```

We are picking the most recent timestamp between the two `TimeValue`s using a
handy helper function that we defined earlier in our calculator interface.

An intended side effect of using a map for this data structure is that, when we
`put` a new value for an existing timestamp, the entry gets overwritten by the
most recent one. This solves our problem with duplicate timestamps.

At the end of the cycle, our results are almost ready. We just need to sort by
timestamp again and return the values as a `List` of `TimeValue`s.

```java
List<Instant> keys = new ArrayList<>(airQualityIndexMap.keySet());
keys.sort(Instant::compareTo);
List<TimeValue> results = new ArrayList<>();

for (Instant key : keys) {
    results.add(TimeValue.of(key, airQualityIndexMap.get(key)));
}
```

## Functional elegance

Can we do better than this? Absolutely. Let's use an elegant weapon for a more
civilized age: functional programming. Our
[FunctionalAirQualityIndexCalculator](https://github.com/mcaserta/time-series-concurrency-example/blob/master/src/main/java/com/mirkocaserta/example/FunctionalAirQualityIndexCalculator.java)
is quite slimmed down, but that's just because the main logic behind the
calculations is now in the
[AirQualityIndexCollector](https://github.com/mcaserta/time-series-concurrency-example/blob/master/src/main/java/com/mirkocaserta/example/AirQualityIndexCollector.java).

Our new calculator is much simpler now. The first part is quite involved so
let's take a look at it first:

```java
List<TypedTimeValue> timeSeries = Stream.concat(
   temperatures.stream().map(e -> new TypedTimeValue(TypedTimeValue.Type.T, e)),
   carbonMonoxidePercentages.stream().map(e -> new TypedTimeValue(TypedTimeValue.Type.C, e))
).collect(Collectors.toUnmodifiableList());
```

There are several functional patterns at work here:

- the temperatures and carbon monoxide percentage data are streamed and mapped
  into a type wrapper in order to later understand if the data we're looking at
  is of type `T` or `C`

- the two resulting streams are concatenated using `Stream.concat`

- in the end we collect the concatenated stream into an unmodifiable
  `List<TypedTimeValue>`

```java
return timeSeries.stream().parallel()
    .collect(AirQualityIndexCollector.toUnmodifiableList(maxTemperature));
```

The `timeSeries` is then streamed in parallel into a collector that does the
real work and returns an unmodifiable `List<TimeValue>` with the air quality
indices.

Let's take a look at the collector.

```java
public class AirQualityIndexCollector
        implements Collector<TypedTimeValue, Queue<TypedTimeValue>, List<TimeValue>> {
    ...
```

We're implementing the `Collector` interface. The type parameters we are
providing here express three things:

- we are collecting values of type `TypedTimeValue`
- our internal accumulator is using a `Queue<TypedTimeValue>`
- at the end of our work, we are returning a `List<TimeValue>`

A `Queue` is just a thread safe `List`. We provide the implementation using the
supplier method:

```java
@Override
public Supplier<Queue<TypedTimeValue>> supplier() {
    return ConcurrentLinkedQueue::new;
}
```

In this case, the implementation is a `ConcurrentLinkedQueue` which, again, is
just sort of a thread safe `ArrayList`.

```java
@Override
public BiConsumer<Queue<TypedTimeValue>, TypedTimeValue> accumulator() {
    return Queue::add;
}
```

The accumulator method must return a function which the collector uses to
accumulate the input data. As you can see, we simply return a reference to the
`add` method in `Queue`.

```java
@Override
public BinaryOperator<Queue<TypedTimeValue>> combiner() {
    return (typedTimeValues, typedTimeValues2) -> {
        typedTimeValues.addAll(typedTimeValues2);
        return typedTimeValues;
    };
}
```

The combiner method must return a function that combines two accumulators. The
implementation should pick all elements from the second accumulator and add them
to the first one, which doesn't sound very functional in terms of immutability
but in this case mutation is an expected behavior, and it's totally fine.

```java
@Override
public Function<Queue<TypedTimeValue>, List<TimeValue>> finisher() {
    ...
```

Finally, the finisher must return a function which takes all the accumulated
values in our `Queue<TypedTimeValue>` and return a `List<TimeValue>` with our
air quality indices.

```java
final Map<Instant, TimeValue> aqiAccumulator = new HashMap<>();
```

This is a map that is going to collect all the air quality indices. As you can
see, it's indexed by a timestamp, so we won't get duplicate entries as more
recent calculations for the same timestamps are put into the map replacing the
stale ones.

```java
return accumulator -> {
   accumulator.stream()
           .map(TypedTimeValue::timestamp)
           .sorted()
           .forEach(entryTS -> {
               final TimeValue lastTemperature = getClosest(accumulator, TypedTimeValue.Type.T, entryTS);
               final TimeValue lastCarbonMonoxidePercentage = getClosest(accumulator, TypedTimeValue.Type.C, entryTS);

               if (lastTemperature != null && lastCarbonMonoxidePercentage != null) {
                   Instant timestamp = mostRecent(lastTemperature.timestamp(), lastCarbonMonoxidePercentage.timestamp());
                   aqiAccumulator.put(timestamp, TimeValue.of(timestamp, airQualityIndex(lastTemperature.value(), lastCarbonMonoxidePercentage.value(), maxTemperature)));
               }
           });

   return aqiAccumulator.values().stream()
           .sorted()
           .collect(Collectors.toUnmodifiableList());
};
```

This is quite a mouthful but let's go through it bit by bit. We are streaming
the accumulated data, extracting the timestamp, sorting by it and, for each
timestamp we look for the temperature and carbon monoxide percentage data with
the closest timestamp. _Closest_ means that the timestamp we're evaluating must
be before of or equal to the timestamp in question.

If we have both data (`T` and `C`), we can proceed to calculate the `AQi` and
put its value into the `aqiAccumulator` map.

In the end, all we have to do is to stream the values in the `aqiAccumulator`
map, sort by timestamp and collect them in an unmodifiable `List<TimeValue>`.

Sorting like this is possible since we made our `TimeValue` class implement
`Comparable<TimeValue>`.

There are several points in the `finisher` method where I look into the
datastructures I'm iterating on, which, again, doesn't look very kosher in terms
of functional programming, but it's okay as I know that the data I'm examining
isn't being changed by a concurrent thread under the hood.

Is this better than our old school calculator? I'm not sure. This is still quite
verbose, but to me it seems easier to read as most of the code is expressed in a
declarative style rather than an imperative one.

## Concurrency considerations

As we need to retrieve two different sets of data from two different providers
(one for temperature data and one for carbon monoxide percentage data), we might
want to run the clients in parallel. This has an advantage over traditional
single threaded execution where you would have to serialize the calls to the
providers.

In a single threaded environment, you might write code like this:

```java
TimeValueProvider providerT = new TemperatureTimeValueProvider();
TimeValueProvider providerC = new CarbonMonoxidePercentageProvider();
List<TimeValue> timeValuesT = providerT.get();
List<TimeValue> timeValuesC = providerC.get();
```

This translates to the following serial execution model:

![sequence diagram for serial execution](../images/posts/sequence-diagram-serial.jpg)

As we said, we can do better than this. In a multithreaded environment, we can
spawn the two clients concurrently and start processing their data as soon as we
receive a response from both. This saves us some time and potentially speeds up
our overall response time.

![sequence diagram for parallel execution](../images/posts/sequence-diagram-parallel.jpg)

How do we implement this execution model in our code? There are several options
but the most popular and the one I personally like the most is to use
`CompletableFuture`s, which were introduced in Java 8 if I recall correctly.

A `CompletableFuture` is a container for a computation. You provide it the code
you want to execute and the Java runtime takes care of running it concurrently
in a threaded scheduler. The scheduler is of course customizable but the
defaults are okay for our simple case here. You can see the complete example
[here](https://github.com/mcaserta/time-series-concurrency-example/blob/master/src/main/java/com/mirkocaserta/example/App.java).

In my example I have declared my `CompletableFuture`s like this:

```java
CompletableFuture<List<TimeValue>> timedValuesFuture1 = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
   log("Calling provider1...");
   List<TimeValue> timeValues = provider1.get();
   log(String.format("provider 1 returned: %s\n", timeValues));
   return timeValues;
});
```

This is a bit verbose as I wanted to include some logging to show you how this
code runs in parallel. I might as well have written:

```java
CompletableFuture<List<TimeValue>> timedValuesFuture1 = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(provider1::get);
```

This is still verbose but definitely better than before. As the computation in
our `CompletableFuture` returns a `List<TimeValue>`, the `supplyAsync` method
returns a `CompletableFuture<List<TimeValue>>`, which is Java's way of saying
that the `timedValuesFuture1` variable is a `CompletableFuture` holding a
`List<TimeValue>`. Please note that the code we are passing to the `supplyAsync`
method is inside a lambda. What this means is that our code doesn't get executed
in the `supplyAsync` method but the Java runtime is free to choose when it's the
best time to run it. The default scheduler will generally start running your
`CompletableFuture`s as soon as they are defined but you need to understand that
this is not necessarily so and that defining a lambda doesn't mean it gets
executed at the point of declaration.

We now need a way to make sure our `CompletableFuture`s have completed their
execution before going on. This is done by composing our futures and calling the
`join` method on the resulting future:

```java
CompletableFuture.allOf(timedValuesFuture1, timedValuesFuture2).join();
```

The `allOf` method returns a new `CompletableFuture` which wraps the futures
we're passing to it. On this new future we then call `join` which blocks until
all the wrapped futures have finished executing.

After this line, we are sure that our threads have run, so we can get the data
we need from our original futures with the `join` method:

```java
List<TimeValue> timeValues1 = timedValuesFuture1.join();
List<TimeValue> timeValues2 = timedValuesFuture2.join();
```

## Example output

When you run the application, you should see output similar to this:

```

```

You can see there are three different threads at work here:

1. main
2. ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-3
3. ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-5

It's interesting to note here that in this specific run `allOf(...).join()` was
called much before calling provider 2 and both results were returned from
providers.

Your output will definitely be different as:

1. the threads' execution order is non-deterministic
2. the providers' values are generated randomly

## Conclusion

You've made it! This was quite the run. I hope it's been entertaining. I spent
quite a bit of time on this as I was trying to dig deeper into some issues I've
had at work. I suggest you do the same when you run into problems that need some
clarification on your side. I also hope you found this useful.
