![A picture of Mirko](../images/mirko.jpg)

I'm a [Senior Developer](./cv.html) in Rome, Italy. I primarily dabble in
enterprise backends. I'm not religious about programming languages, frameworks,
platforms and architectures as I like to live on the bleeding edge and basically
be a curious nerd about practically too many fields in human knowledge.

I also [play music](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0jv0oWHiTvLG9PetrnX5PO) and
I'm sometimes known as [IK0ZSN](https://www.qrz.com/db/ik0zsn).
