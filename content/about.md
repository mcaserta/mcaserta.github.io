![A picture of Mirko](/images/mirko.jpg)

I'm a software developer currently living in Rome, Italy. I primarily dabble in
enterprise backends. I'm not religious about programming languages, frameworks,
platforms and architectures as I like to live on the bleeding edge and
basically be a curious nerd about practically too many fields in human
knowledge.

I also have a past as a musician. My music is
[here](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0jv0oWHiTvLG9PetrnX5PO).

I am also known as [IK0ZSN](https://www.qrz.com/db/ik0zsn).
