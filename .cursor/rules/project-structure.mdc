# Krik Static Site Generator Project Structure

This is a Krik-based static site (Rust static site generator available at https://github.com/mcaserta/krik) with multilingual support (English and Italian). The main content is organized as follows:

## Content Structure
- `content/` - Main content directory
  - `posts/` - Blog posts in markdown format
    - `*.md` - English posts
    - `*.it.md` - Italian posts (same content, different language)
  - `pages/` - Static pages
    - `*.md` - English pages
    - `*.it.md` - Italian pages
  - `images/` - Image assets
    - `posts/` - Images referenced in blog posts
  - `site.toml` - Site configuration

## Key Files
- [content/site.toml](mdc:content/site.toml) - Main site configuration
- [themes/default/theme.toml](mdc:themes/default/theme.toml) - Theme configuration
- [themes/default/templates/](mdc:themes/default/templates/) - HTML templates
- [themes/default/assets/](mdc:themes/default/assets/) - CSS, JS, and font assets

## Multilingual Pattern
When working with content, remember that Italian versions follow the pattern:
- English: `filename.md`
- Italian: `filename.it.md`

Both versions should maintain the same structure and content, just translated.
