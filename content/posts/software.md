Here is a list of software I use every day that is essential in everything I do.

| software                                    | use               |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| [firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/) | web browser       |
| [thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/) | email client      |
| [telegram](https://telegram.org/)           | instant messaging |
| [signal](https://signal.org/)               | secure messaging  |
| [alacritty](https://alacritty.org/)         | terminal emulator |
| [joplin](https://joplinapp.org/)            | note taking       |
| [bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/)         | password manager  |

Firefox is a great browser and probably the single piece of software I spend the
most time with. It's free, open source, it descends from the ashes of Netscape
and Mozilla and isn't as evil as Chrome. I've also given a try to
[Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/) recently, and it's pretty good: the things I
liked the most are the Chromium engine, extensions compatibility and the
integrated email client.

Thunderbird is also a descendant of Netscape and Mozilla and, despite not having
yet a unified inbox, it works great and has all the features I need. I have
quite a few mail accounts configured in it, and it's as smooth as olive oil.

Telegram I find much better than Whatsapp. I just wish most people would throw
away Whatsapp and join the much better alternative.

Signal is what I use whenever I have to exchange sensitive information like
passwords, credit card info, etc.

Alacritty is my terminal of choice. It keeps things simple, it's blazing fast,
the defaults are just perfect. What's not to like?

Joplin is an amazing note-taking app which is available for every platform and
its sync features make it perfect for switching between computers and phones. I
have so much stuff in Joplin.

I have used [KeepassXC](https://keepassxc.org/) since forever but recently
switched to Bitwarden as it's also open source, free, available on all platforms
and the cloud sync feature is also free and essential to me.

These are my choices. I'm not saying they are good for you. I'm just saying I
couldn't live without them.
