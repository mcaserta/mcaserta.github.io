These are a bunch of essential Firefox extensions I use:

- [I don't care about cookies](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/i-dont-care-about-cookies/):
  get rid of cookie warnings from almost all websites
- [Don't track me Google](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/dont-track-me-google1/):
  removes the annoying link-conversion at Google Search, Maps, etc
- [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/):
  an efficient wide-spectrum content blocker
- [Bitwarden](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bitwarden-password-manager/):
  a secure and free password manager for all of your devices
