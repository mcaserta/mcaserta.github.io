<p>The nice thing with instrumental music is that giving titles to songs is maybe
trivial and can sometimes be lots of fun.</p>
<p>I had this album&rsquo;s title written down in a list of possible song names that I
keep in my notebook. I wasn&rsquo;t really thinking about it until I started seeing
the album cover showing up online after I pushed the <em>publish</em> button.</p>
<p>And then it hit me:</p>
<p>Â«The Last Time I Had Fun (It Was A Long Time Ago)Â»</p>
<p>When was the last time I had fun? What does it mean to have fun? What the hell
is fun?</p>
<p>I make no secret of my life long struggle with depression, anxiety, panic
attacks and agoraphobia. I used to be shy about it and keep it to myself as
people see it as a weakness. It isn&rsquo;t. Of course it is not.</p>
<p>When I had my first panic attack I was just in my twenties and it scared me
shitless. I had no idea what was happening to me. I was living in a relatively
small town and I had maybe heard the word <em>depression</em> a few times, always
referring to someone no one would dare go near to.</p>

<p>These days things are a bit better. Mental illness still carries around a stigma
but more and more people are aware of what it means to be depressed, to
experience debilitating anxiety and so on.</p>
<p>I am still scared shitless of my condition but I&rsquo;ve somewhat learned to live
with it. I spend most of my days working at home so I don&rsquo;t get easily
triggered, except for family or job matters. It&rsquo;s manageable though.</p>
<p>But yeah, I can&rsquo;t remember when it was the last time I&rsquo;ve had fun. I&rsquo;ve had
some. The most fun I have these days is playing music for myself at home. So, in
a sense, this is me trying to share some of my fun, knowing that not everyone
has fun the same way and most won&rsquo;t like my music, but some will, and it is for
those that I do this.</p>
