I just released Bruce, a Java library for performing cryptography.

Here are the relevant links:

- [github](https://github.com/mcaserta/bruce)
- [docs](https://bruce.mirkocaserta.com)
- [download](https://jitpack.io/#mcaserta/bruce)

There still is much room for improvement.

If you are new to open source Java library development, a good place to start is
taking a look at the open issues. Most of them are pretty easy.

I hope you find this useful. I certainly have in my daily work.
