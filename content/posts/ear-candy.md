What I find amusing about quotes is that it's very hard to find out if they are
trustworthy. I like to think that the Kapellmeister might actually have said
that. It's quite plausible I think.

Bach wrote music for the glory of his god and for the refreshment of the spirit.
I don't have any gods to glorify other than Charlie Parker and John Coltrane and
no special message to send to the world other than enjoy yourselves and try not
to be hurtful to each other.

I don't really have much to say about this album other than I hope you find it
tolerable.
