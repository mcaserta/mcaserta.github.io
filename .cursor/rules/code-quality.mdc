# Code Quality Standards

## Java Code
- Use meaningful variable names and method names
- Include proper comments for complex algorithms
- Follow Java naming conventions (camelCase for variables/methods, PascalCase for classes)
- Use CompletableFuture for concurrent operations
- Implement proper error handling

## JavaScript/CSS
- Use modern ES6+ syntax where appropriate
- Follow consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Implement responsive design principles

## Code Examples in Posts
- Include complete, runnable code examples
- Provide clear explanations of complex algorithms
- Use step-by-step breakdowns for educational content
- Include output examples where relevant

## Documentation
- Document complex algorithms with clear explanations
- Include sequence diagrams or flowcharts for concurrent operations
- Provide real-world examples and use cases
- Explain both the "what" and "why" of code decisions
